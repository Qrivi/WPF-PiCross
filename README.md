# WPF-PiCross

Small school assingment that required us to provide a GUI for a game of PiCross. We were free to use any features present in the model or implement our own features, as long as the result was a playable, decent looking game with personality. 

Because the initial model was given for this assignment, I do not own or claim any rights on code not written by me.
