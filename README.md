Small school assingment that required us to provide a GUI for a game of PiCross. We were free to implement any features present in the model that was given to us (as long as the result was a playable, decent looking game with personality). Hence, code other than the lines in `/GUI` was granted by the lecturer and is not owned by me in any way.
